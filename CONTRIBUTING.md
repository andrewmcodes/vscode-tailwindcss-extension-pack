# Contributing

There are basically four types of contributions that one could make to this project in my mind.

## Contesting a current extension

Ultimately the extensions in this pack are here based on my biases and I want this to be useful to the entire community. If you would like to debate the value of an extension already in the pack, I am happy to do that as long as it does not devolve into something toxic. See below for a note about contributors and the Code of Conduct.

## Suggesting a new extension

Open a PR and I'd be happy to take a look! Please include a description of why you think the extension should be added, as well as the value it provides. Note that I am not interested in adding any extensions that are specific to a tool like React. The extension should be beneficial to the user whether they are working on a static site or a server rendered environment like Rails or Laravel.

## Finding/Fixing a bug

### Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/andrewmcodes/tailwindcss-extension-pack/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/andrewmcodes/tailwindcss-extension-pack/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and any screenshots/crash reports/etc. demonstrating the issue.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Sharing with others

Whether it is through blogging, podcasting, or just you and a friend talking, sharing the project with others is in my mind a very valuable contribution.

## Code of Conduct

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, you are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This document also details how enforcement of said document will be enforced if necessary.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
