# Tailwind CSS Extension Pack

This extension pack packages some of the more popular and helpful Visual Studio Code extensions for working with Tailwind CSS. It is purposefully framework agnostic, which is why it does not include any of the CSS-in-JS related Tailwind extensions.

**[Get it from the VS Code Marketplace â†’](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andrewmcodes.tailwindcss-extension-pack)**

## Extensions

### [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

Currently maintained by the Tailwind core team, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing Visual Studio Code users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

### [Tailwind Docs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=austenc.tailwind-docs)

A useful extension to help you quickly access the Tailwind documentation via the command palette. This tool will save you tons of time and eliminate the friction of navigating the documentation from your browser.

### [Tailwind Sass Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=macieklad.tailwind-sass-syntax)

Simple extension that adds Tailwind grammar rules for SCSS and Sass files to allow for framework directives syntax highlighting. An example of this is adding syntax highlighting to Tailwind directives, like `@apply`.

### [Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind)

Headwind is an opinionated Tailwind CSS class sorter for Visual Studio Code. It enforces consistent ordering of classes by parsing your code and reprinting class tags to follow a given order.
